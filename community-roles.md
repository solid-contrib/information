They are responsible for keeping these properties clean and well-organised on behalf of the Solid community. The Repositories Manager has admin rights of Solid tools must attend the weekly recurring community support meeting.

## Project Release Manager
The Project Release Managers are responsible for determining which features and/or bug-fixes will be merged into the release of their respective [projects](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects). Project release managers must attend the weekly recurring community support meeting. The Project Release Manager of a specific [project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) is responsible for leading that project. 

## Project Core Contributor
A Project Core Contributor is a key team member on an official Solid project.
They may have issues assigned to them, review and merge pull requests, and must
attend regular stand-ups and project strategy meetings.

## User Testing Panel Coordinator
Panel Coordinators are responsible for designing and running tests with the Solid Panelists as well as publishing test results to the Solid community. Panel Coordinators are expected to join the weekly user testing meeting which is moderated by the Community Manager.

## Solid User Testing Panelist
Solid Panelists are individuals who are available for a range of tests over time to improve the Solid user experience. When there is a test set up by the Panel Coordinators, the Community Manager will reach out to the relevant Solid Panelists to ask if they would like to participate in that particular test. Each test will take approximately 30 minutes, Solid Panelists are not obliged to participate in all tests, and Solid Panelists can stop being on the Solid Panel at any point. Tests will be designed to improve the Solid experience. Solid User Testing Panelists do not take part in the community support meeting nor in the solid/team gitter chat to avoid bias during the test.

## Solid Event Organiser
The [Solid Event](solid-events.md) Organiser is responsible for organising and coordinating a Solid Event in a stated city. The position of Solid Event Organiser will be filled by an individual for as long as an event is scheduled in the future.
