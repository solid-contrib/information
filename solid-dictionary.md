### ACL file (Access Control List)
Defines the properties associated with the level of access of a user. Comprised of classes (e.g., “Agent” this allows anyone and anything to access”)

### File(s)
A piece of data (of some type), that is stored on a Pod server. This file has a url endpoint. 

### Graph Database 
The data storage model used by the semantic web. An RDF graph can be visualized as a node and directed-arc diagram, in which each triple is represented as a node-arc-node link. RDF graphs are set(s) of “subject - predicate - object” triples that are used to express descriptions of resources. The Turtle language is used to express these triples. 

### Homepage
A Solid users' exposed, customizable, profile

### Node
May refer to two things:
aka Node.js, a JavaScript runtime for things not running in a browser, typically running the server.
Or A RDF node, i.e. one thing or string in an RDF graph.

### Object
Target of the link

### [OWL (Web Ontology Language)](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/OWL)
A Semantic Web language that builds on RDF

### Pod (Personal Online Datastore)
A secure repository containing the user’s data. Users control application access to their Pod(s).

### Pod Manager
An application that provides a UI and UX that allows the user to manage their Things, Files, People, and Applications. This management includes permissioning.

### Predicate 
The link type

### PublicKey WebID
A URI that refers to a person that uniquely identifies a user to their public key

### [RDF (Resource Description Framework)](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)
A generic graph-based data model with which to structure and link data on the web. The data model describes Things, including their relationships with other Things. RDF can be written in a number of ways (AKA serialisations), an example of which is Turtle.

https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/

### [RDFS (RDF Schema)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf-schema-20140225/)
An extension of the basic RDF data modelling vocabulary

### [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/)
W3C’s vision of a web of linked data. “Semantic web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data.”

### [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)
The a query language for RDF

### Subject
Source of the link

### Thing(s)
A piece of data, file, or collection of files that can be manipulated, shared, linked to additional things and data, or people via codified known ontologies.

### [Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-turtle-20140225/)
A structural syntax for RDF. “Turtle allows RDF graph to be completely written in a compact and natural text form, with abbreviations for common usage patterns and datatypes.” Provides compatibility with the triple pattern syntax of the SPARQL. All Turtle files have the extension “.ttl”. 

### [WebAccessControl](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl#Resources_covered_by_the_ACL)
A decentralized system for allowing different users and groups of users, forms of access to resources. Users are identified by WebID and groups of users are identified by HTTP URIs.  

### [WebID](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebID)
A unique way to identify an entity such as an individual, company, organisation, or institutions. The WebID allows for an entity to be references using a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) when their profile is hosted on a different web server than their own.
