# The Solid Team 
You can find a list of the [various roles within the Solid community](community-roles.md) as well as the responsibilities associated with each role. To apply to a Solid Team role contact the community manager with your cv and motivation statement. Individuals will be appointed to the roles by the community leader. 

## Community Support Meetings
There are weekly recurring [community support meetings](https://github.com/solid/community/blob/master/community-support-agenda-and-minutes.md) via online calls moderated by the community manager. Individuals with specified community roles need to attend the community support meetings if stated in their role description. To make a suggestion for an agenda item at the community support meeting please submit a pull request directly to the [community support meeting agenda](https://github.com/solid/community/blob/master/community-support-agenda-and-minutes.md). Suggestions will be incorporated by the community manager. If there is a difference of opinion about the incorporation of a suggestion, the community manager and relevant community members will first talk to try and find a compromise. When a compromise cannot be found the community leader will make the final judgement.

## Advisory Board
The Solid advisory board has the role of constructing a plan on how to uphold the original Solid values and mission. The plan needs to promote efficient, effective, inclusive, and transparent governance. The Solid advisory board should submit the plan to the community leader via the community manager. Once the plan has been submitted the advisory board will be dismantled. Advisory board members will be appointed by the Community Leader with the support of the Community Manager. The advisory board will take part in several workshops to discuss the governance issues together. The community manager will be coordinating the workshops. If you would like to suggest an issue to be addressed by the advisory board, please contact the community manager.

# How to Contribute
The Solid Spec is discussed at the [W3C Solid Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/wiki/Main_Page) call which happens biweekly and is [open for anyone to join](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/). You can make specific suggestions which are handled according to the process below. 

## Processes 
Step 1. Making a Suggestion
	If you would like to make a suggestion for a speific change to code or text submit a pull request and if you would like to raise a general point open an [issue](https://github.com/solid/community/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). 
	
 Step 2. Inviting a Conversation around your Suggestion to Find Consensus
	  Let others know about your suggestion by posting it on [solid/suggestions](https://gitter.im/solid/suggestions). Solid/suggestions is not a place to talk about the suggestion, this happens in the pull request or issue itself.How long does it take to process a suggestions? Pull requests and issues associated to the the spec (i.e. [solid spec](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec), [web access control spec](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec), and [webid oidc spec](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec)) and the [community repo](https://github.com/solid/community) need to be open for a minimum of three days to give other a chance to share their opinion to be considered. Pull requests and issues associated to all other repos can be closed immediately and do not have a minimum time they have to be left open unless they deviate from the spec in which case they need to be open for a minimum of three days. 
 
 Step 3. Coming to a Conclusion through Compromise  
 	Who is responsible for processing the suggestion? The repository manager of the repository to which the suggestion pertains to will be responsible for merging and closing the pull request or issue. If there is a difference of opinion, parties are encouraged to talk to find a compromise. If a compromise cannot be met the community leader will make the final judgement.
